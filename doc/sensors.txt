UltraSonicSensors:
==================
Values are represented by float values
	2.0		means	2 meter
	1.0		means	1 meter
	0.1		means	30 centimeters
	0.05	means	5 centimeters
	Infinity	value > 2.4x
	Infinity	value < 0.03

Which values can you trust?
	value < 0.03 are buggy..	(e.g. sometimes it shows 1 meter or Infinity or 7 cm..)
	value > 2.4x show Infinity
	
	so, you can trust values till 2 meters and above 4 or 5 cm in every case!
