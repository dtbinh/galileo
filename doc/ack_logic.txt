Now, what can happen?:
[1]	robotCommand doesn't arrive at the robot.
	pc is waiting for an ack which will never be send / come in,
	but the robot hasn't executed the command you've send, too
	
	SOLUTION: set a timeout when waiting for an ack
			when you call waitForACK() you have to estimate, how long it takes
			to finish the robotCommand you've send before
			if nothing comes in send the robot command again.
			
[2] acknowledgment doesn't arrive at the pc.
	pc is waiting for an ack, robotCommand has been executed
	
	PROBLEM: you don't know at the pc side if the robot has received the cmd
			 to do something, or just the ACK is lost..
	
	SOLUTION: resend robotCommand after a timeout
			robot has to check if he has executed the command or not
			
			=> serial numbers (or acknowledgment numbers, command numbers, .. )
