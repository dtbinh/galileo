Overall you can use NetworkSettings.get<whatever you need>() to get IPs, PORTs or BUFFER size of the packets


src/network/Net.java
====================

YOU CAN USE THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS:

public static void sendACK() {
				   =======
	sry, this is currently unimplemented.. will be working tommorrow, thursday 18.12.
	but feel free to write it inside the code where it is needed


public static void sendRobotCmd(String IP, int PORT, int command) {
				   ============
	WHY:
		this is meant to be sending an command to an robot
		it's a convenent way of sending the robot a command, internally it uses Net.send(String IP, int PORT, byte[] sendData)
		
	DESCRIPTION:
		it puts the int command into a byte[], so you don't have to care about that

	USAGE EXAMPLE:
		sendRobotCmd(NetworkSettings.getEV2IP(), NetworkSettings.getRobotPort(), 110);
		// this will let the robot EV2 drive 10 cm forward



public static void send(String IP, int PORT, byte[] sendData) {
				   ====
	WHY:
		this is the raw implementation of sending packets
		
	DESCRIPTION:
		it sends the data you have put into the byte[] to the destination you specified
		
	USAGE EXAMPLE:
		send(NetworkSettings.getPcIP(), NetworkSettings.getPcPort(), data...);
		// this will send a packet to the computer.. it can also be used send


public static byte[] receive(int PORT) throws IOException {
					 =======
	WHY:
		to receive packets from the computer, when you are on the robot
		or receive packets from the robot, when you are on the computer
	
	DESCRIPTION:
		Creates a Socket on the port you specified and waits till it receives some data
		then it returns the data in an byte[]
	
	USAGE EXAMPLE:
		Net.receive(NetworkSettings.getRobotPort());
		// waits for a packet from the computer
