How to import the project from github!
--------------------------------------
#OPTION 1: CLONE THE REPOSITORY WITH COMMANDLINE
open a terminal, shell
cd to the directory, where you want to store the project
git clone <url>

now go on with import existing project into eclipse


#OPTION 2: CLONE THE REPOSITORY WITH A GUI TOOL
since I don't know which gui tool you're using i can't give a detailed description, but in general there will be a
field where you put in the  github repository url  and clone it

now go on with import existing project into eclipse


#OPTION 3: CLONE THE REPOSITORY DIRECTLY WITH ECLIPSE

you probably have to install this in eclipse, via 'Help - Install new Software' http://www.eclipse.org/egit/download/

in the package explorer right click - import - Git - Projects from Git - Clone URI
insert the repository URL into the URI field
if you want, you can add your username and password, if not you just have to type it when you do a commit
next - choose a local destination and leave the other stuff as it is - next
now import existing project! - next			// IMPORTANT
if the project is clicked just hit Finish


#IMPORT EXISTING PROJECT into eclipse		(this is importing, so you'll have the exact same project structure like everyone else)
right click in the package explorer - import - General - Existing Project into Workspace
Select root directory -> Browse to the destination where you have cloned the repository - OK
if the project isn't clicked, click.
Finish

congratz! now the project is loaded into eclipse and synched via git!


#FINALLY	-	change native library location of lwjgl.jar (used for drawing the map)
right click on the project - Build Path - Configure Build Path
click the small arrow left of lwjgl.jar
double click 'Native library location'
change the osname to the os you're running		(windows, macosx, solaris, linux)

when everyone has this setup, we can add .classpath to the .gitignore file, so we no longer overwrite this.


General Information:
--------------------
folder		description

lib/		All libraries used in the project are here, and are automatically linked to the project, when you import as existing project
doc/		here is some documentation about the code and about general stuff like this file you're reading
res/		contains setting files and a history file
