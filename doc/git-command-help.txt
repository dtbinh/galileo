# general workflow

git status		see the status of your files
				here you'll see which files aren't tracked, which are modified, and which are ready for committing

git pull		get the newest version from the github repository

git push		push your new version, or new files to the github repository

git add <files>		add a file to github

git rm <files>		removes a file from git


# TIPS
always pull before you start working! maybe someone has already changed something!
before you commit and push your stuff I always do a pull, not sure if it's better to do so or not
always upload your changes when you're done!
