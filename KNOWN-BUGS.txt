network/Net.java:
	- packet structure currently ignored
	- ACK logic unimplemented
	
net.properties:
	- canno't be read, when running on the robot...
		this is because eclipse/leJOS only puts the src folder into
		the .jar which is uploaded to the robot..
	
Movements:
	- when telling, drive 10 cm forward, the robot isn't driving 10 cm
